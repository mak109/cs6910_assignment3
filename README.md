## Steps to run the code:
The steps are divided into two categories -
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python script
 
### Jupyter Notebook
To run he Jupter Notebook files download the files and run all the cells in sequential order. We recommend to use Google Colab for using the ipynb files so that there is no dependencies error.
